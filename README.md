Simple TODO list created while learning [ReactJS](https://reactjs.org/) with [MUI](https://mui.com/).

[PREVIEW](https://hrnxm.github.io/react-todo-list/)

Hooks used:

-   `useState` (for local component state)
-   `useContext` (for global state)
-   `useEffect` (for `localStorage` management)
-   `useReducer` (for handling events)

A general goal was to make an example app that combines React with TypeScript, Reducers, and Context.

To do (no pun intended):

-   [ ] Improve responsiveness
-   [x] Make rows editable

Simple TODO list created while learning [ReactJS](https://reactjs.org/) with [MUI](https://mui.com/).

Hooks used:

-   `useState` (for local component state)
-   `useContext` (for global state)
-   `useEffect` (for `localStorage` management)
-   `useReducer` (for handling events)

A general goal was to make an example app that combines Reducers and Context.
